## Big_Data_Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of implementations for key Big Data and Machine Learning algorithms, originally taken from the book Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C. Müller and Sarah Guido, published by O'Reilly. The purpose of this repository is educational: to provide easy access and understanding of various Big Data algorithms using Python, especially for those learning or working in the field of data science.

# Algorithms Included (coming soon)

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Means Clustering
4. Decision Trees
5. Random Forests
6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
7. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
8. Gradient Boosting Machines
9. Neural Networks (coming soon)
And more...

Each algorithm is presented in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), following the implementation as described in the book. The notebooks are designed to help users understand the logic and steps involved in each algorithm.

# How to Use
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/llorenscapotorres/Big_Data_Algorithms.git

Navigate to the folder of the specific algorithm you are interested in.
Open the corresponding Jupyter Notebook and run the code to explore how the algorithm works.
